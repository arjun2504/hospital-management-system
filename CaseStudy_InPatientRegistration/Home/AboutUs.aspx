                                     With 100 to 150 beds per medical facility, two-storey buildings for smoother patient flow and new medical 
                                     technologies to decrease the levels of invasive treatments, the efficiency of patient care is 
                                     optimised resulting in a shorter length of stay.In turn, this results in transparency in rates with better
                                     affordability for patients. But as progressive as medical technology can be,the difference in healthcare 
                                     relies much on its people – highly skilled medical consultants, caring nurses as well as teams of 
                                     committed staff who see to every patient’s need, on the road to recovery.
